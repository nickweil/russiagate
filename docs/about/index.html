<h1>What is the point of all this?</h1>
<p>The text messages between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are part of the larger story usually called Spygate or Russiagate. The 30,000-foot-view of the story is this: during the 2016 campaign season, then-candidate Trump was widely accused of being a stooge of the Kremlin and colluding or conspiring with Russia to â€œsteal" the US election. This accusation actually kicked into overdrive AFTER he was elected with the issuance of official government assessments accusing him of such. However, thanks to a few intrepid patriots, that accusation has been proven to be a lie and now the underlying corruption network which allowed that lie to be propogated and spread is being exposed.</p>

<h1>Why do we care about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page?</h1>
<p>Through a potent brew of of ambition, bureaucratic competence, political zeal and divine timing, Strzok and Page seems have stumbled straight into the center of this mess. That's not to say they are the core conspirators and in fact, they might not be even close to that. However, their text messages deserve much attention because they provide connective tissue between many disparate pieces of this story. Using these messages, we can place important events in their proper context; essentially they provide continuous narration of the events from the point of view of direct participants.</p>

<p>Understand that this story is a huge puzzle. We have been given some pieces already and seem to have put them together but there are so many holes yet to be filled. Simply by organizing the mountains of available information we can make startling discoveries and advance the story. Through careful analysis, perhaps we can actually machete through this forest of darkness and mirrors, put the puzzle together, and finally get to the truth of what happened.</p>

<h1>What are the sources of this information?</h1>
<p>On the left hand side of the search page, there is a section where you can filter by "batch." Here is a description of each of the "batch" sources in that list:</p>

<h3>"Ron Johnson"</h3>
<p>Senator Ron Johnson has played a key role in uncovering these text messages. The document he released, labeled <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Appendix%20C%20-%20Documents.pdf"> "Appendix C"</a>, accounts for 90% of the texts messages we currently have. That "Appendix C" document can be subdivided into three different parts and the last part (pages 120 through 502) of the PDF is what I'm calling batch "Ron Johnson." Within that batch, there are inconsistencies in formatting and footer labeling, so clearly DOJ produced a few date ranges separately and glued them together but overall, this batch contains the most complete picture we have.
<h3>"DCNF"</h3>
<p>This batch is labeled "DCNF" for "Daily Caller News Foundation" who exclusively published a PDF of recovered text messages in <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2018/04/27/read-the-strozk-page-texts-in-full/">this article</a>. This batch contains texts that don't appear anywhere else and are from a date range (Dec. 16, 2016 through May 23, 2017) that was excluded from previous releases.</p>
<h3>"House Intel"</h3>
<p>The texts of this batch also come from the document called labeled <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Appendix%20C%20-%20Documents.pdf"> "Appendix C"</a>. If you split "Appendix C" into three parts as I mentioned above, this one would be part two (pages 29 through 118 of the PDF). This batch contains a lot of overlap with the "Ron Johnson" batch but I have removed duplicative messages from the search database for clarity.</p>
<h3>"Horowitz Report"</h3>
<h3>"Brooke Singman"</h3>
<h3>"Meadows Letter"</h3>
<h3>"Sara Carter"</h3>

<p>These names might not be as descriptive as they could be. Feel free to reach out if you have an idea to better name these batches. The names should be specific enough to identify the exact release while compact enough to not get unweildly.</p>

<h1>Are there plans to expand this tool?</h1>
<p>There are quite a few ways this site can be expanded in a useful way. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show messages in a familiar format-</li>
<li>Integrate overall timeline-</li>
<li>Use pop ups for names-</li>
<li>Integrate organization charts-</li>
<li>Make it easier to navigate dates-</li>
</ul>

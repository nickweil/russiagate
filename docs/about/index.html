<h1>What is the point of all this?</h1>
<p>The text messages between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are part of the larger story usually called Spygate or Russiagate. The 30,000-foot-view of the story is this: during the 2016 presidential election, then-candidate Trump was widely accused of being a stooge of the Kremlin and colluding or conspiring with Russia to â€œsteal" the US election. This accusation actually kicked into overdrive AFTER he was elected with the issuance of official government assessments accusing him of such. However, thanks to a few intrepid patriots, that accusation has been proven to be a lie and now the underlying corruption network which allowed that lie to be propogated and spread is being exposed.</p>

<h1>Why do we care about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page?</h1>
<p>Through a potent brew of of ambition, bureaucratic competence, political zeal and divine timing, Strzok and Page seems have stumbled straight into the center of this mess. That's not to say they are the core conspirators and in fact, they might not be even close to that. However, their text messages deserve much attention because they provide connective tissue between many disparate pieces of this story. Using these messages, we can place important events in their proper context; essentially they provide continuous narration of the events from the point of view of direct participants.</p>

<p>Understand that this story is a huge puzzle. We have been given some pieces already and seem to have put them together but there are so many holes yet to be filled. Simply by organizing the mountains of available information we can make startling discoveries and advance the story. Through careful analysis and group effort, perhaps we can actually machete through this forest of darkness and mirrors; to put the vast puzzle together. And finally get to the truth of what happened.</p>

<h1>What are the sources of this information?</h1>

<h1>Are there plans to expand this tool?</h1>
<p>There are quite a few ways this site can be expanded in a useful way. For example, it would be helpful to display the texts as actual texts rather than images.</p>

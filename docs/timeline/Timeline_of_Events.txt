Putin has no respect for President Obama. Big problem. Big problem. And Russia has been driven — you know I’ve always heard, for years I’ve heard, one of the worst things that can happen is if Russia ever gets driven to China. We have driven them together, with the big oil deals that are being made. We’ve driven them together. That’s a horrible thing for this country. We have made them friends because of incompetent leadership. I believe I would get along very nicely with Putin, okay? And I mean where we have the strength. I don’t think you’d need the sanctions."

Campaign re-assesses everything. “'I asked a Clinton staffer about this,' said Sullivan, who around that time briefly went online to research Irish double-citizenship out of her revulsion with the Republican nominee-to-be. 'He said, ‘Well, you know, now we have to save the republic.’ It was a great paradox after nearly a year of virtual certainty—and outright enthusiasm—about their ultimate opponent that her team would swing between overconfidence, denial and disbelief as it struggled to concoct an electoral formula for stopping Trump. It was supposed to be Jeb Bush, if you asked Democratic honchos in mid-2015, except when it was always supposed to be Scott Walker. Eventually, they insisted, it was always supposed to be Rubio."

McCabe called Flynn at 12:30pm and Flynn agreed to be interviewed that day at 2:30p.m. McCabe may have documented the conversation. Comey was going to tell Yates right before the interview, but she called him first for another reason before he had a chance to call. When he told her the FBI was interviewing Flynn she was not happy." archive.is/P19VI
| Jan 24, 2017 | [Name redacted] memo: "Strzok and FBI SSA [redacted], his interview partner, got access to the White House with the assistance of an FBI White House detailee. Flynn met them at about 2:15, which was earlier than agreed. Flynn was alone and 'relaxed and jocular.' He wanted to give them a little tour of the area around his office. During their walk through the West Wing, President Trump and some movers who were dicussing where to place some art work walked between Strzok and [redacted], but nobody paid attention to the agents. Flynn did not introduce them to anyone." archive.is/EPQpl
| Jan 24, 2017 | [Name redacted] memo: "Before the interview, McCabe, [redacted] and others decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed, and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport." archive.fo/qvxQT
| Jan 24, 2017 | [Name redacted] memo: "Flynn was unguarded and clearly saw the FBI agents as allies. He talked about various subjects, including hotels where they stayed during the campaign and the President's knack for interior design. He talked about the long hours of the job and complained about the politics surrounding it, but Flynn always seemed to work his way to the subject of terrorism. Flynn was so talkative, and had so much time for them, that Strzok wondered if the National Security Adviser did not have more important things to do than have such a relaxed, non-pertinent discussion with them." archive.fo/qvxQT
| Jan 24, 2017 | [Name redacted] memo: "Throughout the interview, Flynn had a very 'sure' demeanor and did not give any indicators of deception. He did not parse his words or hesitate in any of his answers. He only hedged twice, which they documented in the 302. Strzok and [redacted] both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying. Flynn struck Strzok as 'bright, but not profoundly sophisticated.'" archive.fo/7o86X
| Jan 24, 2017 | [Name redacted] memo: "Strzok and [redacted] returned to the FBI Headquarters and briefed McCabe and [redacted] on the interview. McCabe briefed Comey. Strzok was aware that [redacted] and [redacted] later argued about the FBI's decision to interview Flynn." archive.is/duRUo

"I have been forthright about the fact that Julian Assange of Wikileaks and I share a common friend who has communicated with both of us, I was simply told Wikileaks was in possession of 'political dynamite' that would 'rock Hillary's campaign,' and they would release it in late October. I had no previous knowledge of the subject of the disclosures, although I've speculated that it would be related to the Clinton Foundation. I've had no advance knowledge of the hacking of Podesta or anyone else. Nor do I believe that Assange is an agent of the Russians, a charge which is yet undocumented with proof and which he denies."

As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy." 
| Jan 31, 2018 | Nunes Statement: "Having stonewalled Congress’ demands for information for nearly a year, it’s no surprise to see the FBI and DOJ issue spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses at these agencies. The FBI is intimately familiar with ‘material omissions’ with respect to their presentations to both Congress and the courts, and they are welcome to make public, to the greatest extent possible, all the information they have on these abuses. Regardless, it’s clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign. Once the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again."
